# Personal Finance Manager Application Project

The aim of this Python project is to build a personal financial manager application that allows the user to track and manage finances (funds and expenses).

The application prompts the user for input, and allows the user to type in amounts and select categories for both funds and expenses directly into the terminal. The application then saves the financial record of the user to a file. Finally, the application allows users to view the summary of their expenses and check the current balance of the total amount entered.

# Application Features

1.  Ask the user to enter funds and expense
2.  Show funds and expenses by category
3.  Save the user input as a csv file
4.  Read the file to summarise the financial record

# Task

1.  Create the financial manager class
2.  Create the constructor
3.  Create the instance methods
4.   Run the app to check if it runs
5.  Create a test_main.py file
6.  Use pytest (code: pytest test_main.py) to check whether the code works correctly
