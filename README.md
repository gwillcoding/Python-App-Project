# Personal Finance Manager Application Project

The aim of this Python project is to build a personal financial manager application that allows the user to track and manage finances (funds and expenses).
The application prompts the user for input, and allows the user to type in amounts and select categories for both funds and expenses directly into the terminal. The application then saves the financial record of the user to a file. Finally, the application allows users to view a summary of their expenses and the balance of the total amount entered
